# Share to Email (Android App)

**Share to Email** is a lightweight Android helper app that lets you send content from the Android share menu **directly into an email draft** — to **predefined recipient** and via a **fixed email app** (for example Gmail), without showing the system chooser every time.

It is designed for fast, repetitive workflows such as:
- “Share → send to my archive email”
- “Share → send to work / project address”
- “Share → send to support or ticket system”

---

## What the App Does

Once installed and configured, Share to Email adds **three dedicated entries** to the Android share menu:

- **Share to @A**
- **Share to @B**
- **Share to @C**

Each entry represents a **preconfigured email recipient**.  
Selecting one of them immediately opens your chosen email app with a prepared email draft.

---

## Typical Usage Flow

1. Open any app that supports sharing (Browser, Gallery, Files, Notes, …)
2. Tap **Share**
3. Select **Share to @A / @B / @C**
4. Your email app opens instantly with:
   - recipient filled in
   - subject and body prepared
   - attachments added (if any)

No app chooser. No copy & paste.

## Initial Setup (Required)

After installing the APK:

1. Open **Share to Email**
2. Configure up to **three recipients**:
   - Recipient for **Share to @A**
   - Recipient for **Share to @B**
   - Recipient for **Share to @C**
3. Choose a **Default Email App** (e.g. Gmail, Outlook)

**Sending will not work until a default email app is selected.**

## Share Targets (A / B / C)

Each share target is independent:

- Each one has its **own recipient**
- If a recipient is empty, that target is considered inactive
- This allows multiple workflows, for example:
  - `@A` → personal archive
  - `@B` → work email
  - `@C` → support or issue tracking

---

## Supported Content

Share to Email supports:

- **Plain text** (notes, copied text, links)
- **URLs**
- **Single or multiple attachments**
  - Images
  - PDFs
  - Files from file managers

For maximum compatibility, the email body is sent as **plain text**.

---

## Email App Behavior

- You explicitly select **one email app** in the settings
- That app is used **directly**, without showing the Android chooser
- If the selected email app is no longer installed:
  - the setting is cleared
  - you are asked to select a new one

This ensures predictable, fast behavior.

---

## Privacy

- No data is uploaded anywhere
- No background services
- All configuration is stored locally on the device
- The app only reacts when you explicitly use the Android share menu

---

## Installation

1. Download the **APK** from this website
2. Install it on your Android device  
   (You may need to allow installation from unknown sources)
3. Open the app and complete the initial setup

## Why This App Exists

Android’s default sharing flow is powerful but often slow:
- multiple taps
- repeated app selection
- repeated recipient input

**Share to Email** removes that friction for users who frequently send content via email to the same destinations.
